\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of current progress prediction methods on the currently used benchmark datasets. 
We show that on the currently used datasets, the progress prediction methods can fail to extract useful information from visual data, and are exceeded by simple non-learning baselines based on frame counting. 
Additionally, we evaluate all the methods on a synthetic dataset we specifically design for the progress prediction task. 
On our synthetic dataset the results show that all the methods can make use of the visual information and outperform the naive, non-learning baselines. 
We conclude that in its current form the task of progress prediction is ill-posed, as the currently used datasets for progress prediction are not suitable for this task.
